# Since this is for the collector which uses the public endpoint, we usually need keys.
# However, the collector configuration uses the Basic Auth header with public:secret keys.
# Please register a project in Langfuse UI (http://localhost:18888) and get the public/secret keys.
# Then base64 encode "public_key:secret_key" and put it above.
